This project is a C implementation of autocomplete functionality. It reads a list of terms from a file, each term paired with an importance weight, and allows the user to search for terms that begin with a specific prefix. For example, a query like "Eng" might return terms such as "Engineering" or "English" that start with that prefix.

The program begins by reading and storing all the terms from a given file. It then sorts the list of terms in lexicographic order to allow efficient searching. When a query is entered, the program uses binary search to find the first and last positions in the list where the prefix matches. These operations are designed to run in logarithmic time for efficiency.

Once the relevant matches are found, the program extracts them and sorts them by their weight using the standard C library function qsort. The result is a list of top matching terms sorted by importance, which can be used to suggest relevant results quickly.

The project includes four main functions: one for reading and sorting the terms, two for finding the matching range using binary search, and one for generating the final autocomplete results.
